######### LAB 1 - R Intro ############

### Using R ###

# q(), or use the graphical menu, to quit R.

# savehistory("history.r")

# loadhistory("history.r")

# source("command.r")

# save.image("myfile.Rdata")

# load("myfile.RData") 

# R gets confused if you use a path in your code like c:\mydocuments\myfile.txt
# This is because R sees "\" as an escape character. Instead, use c:/mydocuments/myfile.txt
# Use the slash symbol instead of the backslash or the double backslash

getwd()   # print the current working directory
# setwd(c:/docs/mydirectory)  # change the current working directory to "mydirectory"
ls()   # list the objects in the current workspace

### R as calculator ###

# + and - for addition and subtraction
# * and / for multiplication and division
# ^ for exponents
# %% is the modulo operator
# %\% for integer division

# print() # prints objects
# log() # computes logarithms
# exp() # computes the exponential function
# sqrt() # takes the square root
# abs() # returns the absolute value
# sin() # returns the sine
# cos() # returns the cosine
# tan() # returns the tangent
# asin() # returns the arc-sine
# factorial() # returns the factorial
# sign() # returns the sign (negative or positive)
# round() # rounds the input to the desired digit

#  # this is a comment

### Logical Operators ###

# < less than
# <= less than or equal to
# > greater than
# >= greater than or equal to
# == equal
# != not equal
# & and
# | or

1 == 1
1 == 2
1 != 2
1 <= 2 & 1 <= 3
1 == 1 | 1 == 2
1 > 1 | 1 > 2 & 3 == 3
1 > 1 & 1 > 2 & 1 > 3

### R's help function ###

?log

apropos("mean") # when the name is not known exactly

### Packages and libraries ###

# install.packages("package")  to istall a package

# library("package")  to load the package

# update.packages()  To update packages


### Assignment and reference ###

1 + 2 # the result is not saved, it is only printed on the screen 
x <- sqrt(2)   # the square root of 2 is saved in x
x   # in order to print the content of x
x^3
y <- x^3
y
x <- pi # a new assignment erases the former one
x
is(x)

ls() # to see what objects are in the current working directory
rm(x) # to remove object x
# rm(list = ls()) # to remove all objects
